11/11/2013 - 12/15/2014



A) What to Avoid ? 




-> 5 year should not be a drop (end point < start point in the period):
	-> 5  year (go by percentile as well... to endure stable pattern; point should be in the middle 40th-60th percentile ?)



-> 1 year must not be decreasing, but the increase % should be low:


-> MA 52 must be uppity


-> Monitior Magintitude of Change... should be not huge change


-> monitor huge spikes --> avoid recent spikes :
	-> MAX and MIN should not differ by huge amount (Range)
	-> MA(52) is on upward (for a period of a month minimum)


# MA 52 approaching MA 200
